# Zone Detection Improvements for Drag & Drop

## Summary of Changes

I've completely redesigned the zone detection system for the drag & drop functionality to make it more reliable and consistent. Here's what was changed:

### Previous Approach (Issues)
- Single drop zone with mouse position calculation
- Inconsistent event capturing during drag operations
- Zone detection based on `onMouseMove` events that were not reliably fired
- Complex state management between refs and state

### New Approach (Improvements)
1. **Multiple Drop Zones**: Instead of one drop zone with position detection, I've created three separate drop zones:
   - First zone: 9:00-11:00 (morning) or 15:00-17:00 (afternoon)
   - Full zone: 9:00-14:30 (morning) or 15:00-19:30 (afternoon)
   - Second zone: 11:30-13:30 (morning) or 17:30-19:30 (afternoon)

2. **Individual Droppable Components**: Each zone is now its own `useDroppable` instance with:
   - Clear visual boundaries
   - Individual hover states
   - Zone information passed directly in the drop data

3. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Clear visual indicators for each zone when dragging
   - Zone labels in Catalan (Primera part, Horari complet, Segona part)
   - Disabled zones when slots are already occupied
   - Debug panel to monitor drag operations (can be toggled off)

4. **Reliability**: 
   - No more reliance on mouse position calculations
   - Direct zone detection through the @dnd-kit library's built-in mechanisms
   - Zone information is embedded in the drop data

## How to Use

1. Select a group and semester from the dropdowns
2. Drag a subject from the left panel
3. As you hover over a time slot, you'll see three distinct zones:
   - Top zone: First part of the time slot
   - Middle zone: Full time slot
   - Bottom zone: Second part of the time slot
4. Drop the subject on the desired zone
5. The system will create an assignment with the appropriate time range

## Technical Details

### Key Components Modified:
- `TimeSlotDroppable`: Now renders three separate `TimeSlotZone` components
- `TimeSlotZone`: New component that handles individual zone drops
- `handleDragEnd`: Updated to read zone information directly from drop data

### Database Support:
The database already supports partial time slots through flexible `start_time` and `end_time` fields in the `time_slots` table.

## Testing

To test the improvements:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/assignacions-aules
2. Select a degree, year, group, and semester
3. Try dragging subjects to different zones within a time slot
4. Verify that assignments are created with the correct time ranges
5. Use the debug panel (bottom right) to monitor zone detection

The zone detection should now work consistently every time!
